- 👋 Hi, I’m Jerry Son.
- 👀 I’m interested in **Tesla** E/E architecture to catch up with their technology achievements particularly in terms of software.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning competing **Vehicle API** such as VHAL (Android), VSS (COVESA), and so on so that the two realms - vehicle computers and legacy CAN clusters - can be efficiently interconnected.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **3D modelling** so that it will be integrated with vehicle HMI. My final goal is to implement user experiences such as Tesla Touchscreen UI including FSD.
- 📫 How to reach me: write to jerry.son77@gmail.com or find 'Jerry Son' @linkedin
